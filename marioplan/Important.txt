react-redux-firebase latest version doesn't work with v7.0 latest.
Because Can't use this part:
import { firestoreConnect } from 'react-redux-firebase'
export default compose(
    connect(mapStateToProps),
    firestoreConnect([
        { collection: 'projects'}
      ])
)(Dashboard)

with latest react-redux-firebase and react-redux, error shows with firestoreConnect function.
So upgrade version with this:
npm i --save react-redux@5.1.1
npm i --save react-redux-firebase@2.2.4
And That works correctly.
